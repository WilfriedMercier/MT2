# MT2

## Description

Repository containing my 2nd Master project on parallel computing. The objective was to parrallellize a code which solved Burger equation on turbulent motion with both OpenMP and MPI. All the codes are in Fortran.

## Scalaire folder

It contains the scalar version of the code which solved Burger equation.

## Vn folders with n from 3 to 8

Folders containing the different parrallellized versions of the code. To see how well the different versions behave, look at the SpeedUps.pdf file in Presentation folder.

## VMPI folder

The only MPI version avaiblable. The code can be compiled and launched but the results are not physically correct.

## Presentation folder

All the files related to the oral presentation are present here.
